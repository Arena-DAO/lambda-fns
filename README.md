# Arena Lambda Functions

This repository contains serverless Lambda functions designed to enable **Discord identity integration** with the Neutron blockchain for Arena DAO. These functions facilitate seamless linking of Discord profiles with Neutron addresses while empowering users with gas funds for their initial blockchain interactions.

## Features

- **Neutron Address Linking**: Securely link Neutron blockchain addresses to Discord profiles for identity verification and streamlined community participation.
- **Gas Fund Allocation**: Automatically provide users with a small amount of gas funds to jumpstart their interactions on Neutron without additional barriers.
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Utilize Discord's OAuth2 for secure and user-friendly authentication.
- **Community Automation**: Enhance Discord role management and permissions through on-chain identity integration.

## Use Cases

- **Onboarding**: Simplify the onboarding process by linking Discord profiles to Neutron blockchain addresses, allowing users to participate in Arena DAO's activities seamlessly.
- **Gasless Interactions**: Lower the barrier to entry by providing gas funds to users for initial transactions.
- **Community Management**: Automate role assignments and verification within Discord, tied directly to Neutron-based identities.
